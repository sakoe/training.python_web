Winter Term, 2014 (10 sessions)

Tuesdays, 6-9 pm, January 7 - March 11


Overview
========

This course emphasizes network-based programming and Web
applications, how they work and how to program them in Python. Explore the
underlying principles and their expression in the Python libraries. Learn
contrasting approaches in creating applications: programming with the
low-level libraries versus using highly integrated frameworks


Prerequisites
=============

To attend this course you should have a working knowledge of the basic
syntax and structures of the Python programming language. You will also need
to be comfortable working at the command line to navigate a file system,
create and delete files, and execute commands. Finally, you should have some
basic knowledge of HTML.


Requirements
============

This workshop does not provide a computer laboratory. You will have to have a
portable computer in order to participate. Network access is provided, but you will need to know how to operate the
network settings for your computer.

Your computer must have Python version 2.6 or 2.7 installed. No additional
libraries will be required, but we will be installing some as the workshop
progresses.

You will want to familiarize yourself with `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_.  We will use it extensively in class
in order to keep our development environments clean and separate.


What to Expect
==============

This course will cover the fundamental concepts of networked programming in
Python. You'll learn everything, starting from the sockets that enable
communications between processes and machines and the basic protocols that
govern this communication, right up to the full-stack frameworks that enable
developers to build rich applications efficiently.

Along the way, you'll learn through a combination of lecture and activity.
Historical information will be combined with exercises designed to help you
learn the Pythonic way to create programs that interact with each-other across
networks. Each module will include reading lists for more information.
Homework assignments will allow you to dive more deeply into the concepts
introduced in class.

**This class is** intended to give students a solid grounding in the
fundamentals of network programming. You will gain a basic understanding of a
broad range of Pythonic tools and learn to choose the right tool for a given
task.

**This class is not** an in-depth course in any single Python web framework.
The intention is to give you the information needed to select the right
framework for your task. To that end, you will learn the basics of the
frameworks covered as well as the choices and compromises that shape them.
